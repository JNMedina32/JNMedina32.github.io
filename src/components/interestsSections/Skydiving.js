      <h2>Jumping from planes!</h2>
      <p>The first time I jumped from a plane while in flight was during the third week of the US Army Airborne School. Although I was terrified at first, I loved the feeling of overcoming my fears, and the thrill that accompanied it. It was the beginning of one of my favorite hobbies, SKydiving!</p>
